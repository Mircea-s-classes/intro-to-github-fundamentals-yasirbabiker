 What I Learned
- I learned how to create and work with a repository on GitHub.  
- I now understand the difference between Git and GitHub.  
- I learned about cloning, committing, and pushing changes.  
- I got familiar with branches, pull requests, and issues.  

What I’m Still Unsure About
- I am still a little unsure about when to use branching vs. forking.  
- I need more practice with resolving merge conflicts.  
- I’m not fully confident yet in using Git commands on the terminal compared to the GitHub web interface.
